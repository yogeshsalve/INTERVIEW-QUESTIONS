This data was usually fetched from a database. After combining the template and data, we would serve the generated HTML content back to the user. As you can see, it was a bit complicated, and in some cases, it took a lot of processing. \n\nTo overcome these issues, people came up with another approach in which they send the necessary data to render a page from their web servers to the web browsers and let JavaScript combine this data with a predefined template. Since now, even mobile phones are powerful enough to do this kind of processing, the servers can now just send the data to a client over the internet in a recognizable format, i.e., JSON, XML, etc. This drastically reduces the processing done on the servers and improves performance.",

Although, it is something that should be used with careful consideration as it could lead to poor application performance or performance degradation as time goes on. It is called two-way data binding because we can change some data that is in the component model from the view that is HTML, and that change can also propagate to all other places in the view where it is displayed.",

All Angular applications have a minimum of one component called the root component. This component is bootstrapped in the root module, the main module. All the components include the logic of the application that is defined in a class, while the main role of the class is to interact with the view using an API of functions and properties. \n\nData binding: Data binding is the process in which the various sections of a template interact with the component. The binding markup needs to be added to the HTML template so that Angular can understand how it can connect with the component and template. \n\nDependency injection: It uses DI so that it can offer the necessary dependencies, mainly services, to the new components. The constructor parameters of a component inform Angular regarding the numerous services needed by the component, and DI provides a solution that gives the necessary dependencies to the new class instances. \n\nDirectives: Angular templates are of dynamic nature, and directives help Angular understand how it can transform the DOM while manifesting the template. \n\nMetadata: Classes have metadata attached to them with the help of decorators so that Angular will have an idea of processing the class. \n\nModules: Module or NgModule is a block of code organized using the necessary capabilities set, having one specific workflow. All Angular applications have at least one module, the root module, and most of the applications have numerous modules. \n\nRouting: Angular router helps interpret the URL of a browser to get a client-generated experience and view. This router is bound to page links so that Angular can go to the application view as soon as the user clicks on it. \n\nServices: Service is a vast category that ranges from functions and values to features that play a significant role in Angular application. \n\nTemplate: The view of each component is linked with a template, and an Angular template is a type of HTML tag that allows Angular to get an idea of how it needs to render the component.",

The view must subscribe to the observables that are exposed to it by the ViewModel to receive a response. \n\nViewModel: ViewModel is the application’s abstract layer that connects the View and the Model and acts as a bridge between the two.

It is used to define a single piece of the user interface using TypeScript code, CSS styles, and the HTML template. When we define a component, we use the component decorated with the @ symbol and pass in an object with a selector attribute. The selector attribute gives the Angular compiler the HTML tag that the component is associated with so that, now, when it encounters this tag in HTML, it knows to replace it with the component template. \n\nStructural: Structural directives are used to change the structure of a view. For example, if we wish to show or hide some data based on some property, we can do so by using the ngIf directive, or if we wish to add a list of data in the markup, we can use *ngFor, and so on. These directives are called structural directives because they change the structure of the template.\n\nAttribute: Attribute directives change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive. They are used as the attributes of elements. Directives such as ngClass and ngStyle are attribute directives.",

The JIT compiler is used to compile TypeScript to JavaScript as our browsers cannot understand TypeScript but only JavaScript. This compilation step is done in a development environment, i.e., when less time is needed to be spent on compilation and more in development to quickly iterate over features. The JIT compiler is used when we use ng serve or ng build command to serve the app locally or create an uncompressed build of the entire codebase. \n\nOn the other hand, the AOT compiler is used to create a minified production build of the entire codebase, which can be used in production. To use the AOT compiler, we have to use the ng build command with the –prod blog: ng build –prod. This instructs the Angular CLI to create an optimized production build of the codebase. This takes a bit more time because several optimizations such as minification can take time, but for production builds, this time can be spared.",
